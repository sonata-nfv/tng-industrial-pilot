# Smart-Manufacturing pilot - Network Service 2+ - MDC with IDS and ELK

NS2+ is build of five CNF's: 
1. a customized Machine Data Collector (MDC) 
2. a Suricata-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) with Filebeat log shipper
3. the Logstash ETL (*)
4. the Elasticsearch TSDB (*)
5. the Kibana visualizer (*)
(*) based on official image from ES

## MDC
This CNF exposes a SAMBA share (CIFS protocol) for the factory machinery to send EM63 formated messages. You can use the 'smbclient' to test the CIFS share - ex:

`$ smbclient -L "SAMBA-SRV"`

## IDS
This CNF contains two VDU's: 
- a Suricata-based VDU running in promiscuos mode (`hostNetwork: true`)
- a Filebeat agent that ships formatted log messages generated by Suricata ('eve.json') to the Logstash CNF


## LOGSTASH
This CNF accepts input Beats (Lumberjack protocol) from the Filebeat agent instaled on the Suricata CNF, applies a convenient filter or enrich data received and outputs to Elasticsearch


## ELASTICSEARCH
This CNF is a Time Series Data Base 


## KIBANA
This CNF is a web application with dashboards for data visualization
